                        Resource management is a class meant for seniors and is a course that can be taken either in the fall semester or the spring semester of senior year. Students are required to take either 
                        Resource Management or Consumer Math in order to graduate from Central A & M High School. The focus of the curriculum in Resource Management is to teach students the basics of income taxes,
                        sales tax, and property tax. Students will also learn about banking, savings, car loans, house loans, health insurance, and more skills that are important to becoming a successful adult after 
                        high school.

                        with students learning how to calculate payroll taxes, income taxes, sales tax, and property tax.

                        Unit number 2 in Resource Management is when students begin to learn about the banking system and how they can prepare for their financial future. Students will get a brief lesson on the history
                        of banking followed by the basics of checking and savings accounts. After learning the basics, students will learn the basic principles of the Dave Ramsey style of financial security. Students
                        will understand how they can set and achieve financial goals without going into cripling debt.

                        Students will have the opportunity to take control of the classroom with two final projects that are completed at the end of the semester. Students will complete two projects where they are 
                        in control of their own learning. For the first project, students will work in pairs or in groups to teach their fellow classmates about a chosen subject. The second project will allow students
                        to pick a single topic from the semester and conduct a deep dive into a single question about that subject. Once the student has become an expert on the information they will present their findings
                        to their classmates.
