                        My name is Tyler Niebrugge and I have been the Business and Technology director here at Central A & M High School for six years. When I first started at Central A & M High School, the curriculum 
                        included 2 sections of keyboarding, web development, web programming, economics, resource management, introduction to business, computer concepts, and advanced computer concepts. During my first 
                        year we changed one section of keyboarding to a class about drones and robotics for one semester and python programming for the second semester. 
                    </p>
             
                    <p>
                        Economics and Introduction to Business are no longer options to take here at Central A & M High School. Instead we have spread resource management to four sections instead of just 2. Resource management is aligned to the needs of students to become successful after
                        high school. The curriculum is designed to teach students how to calculate taxes and why they have to pay those taxes. During that class students will also learn how to get loans for homes and 
                        automobiles, and learn the importance of life insurance as well as health insurance.
                    </p>
                 
                    <p>
                        At the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year the STEM curriculum in our STEM lab turned into a full blown class. Previously, students had the option to go into the STEM lab and complete projects
                        whenever they had free time (study halls). Since a lot of students have their study hall during 8th period and the early out incentive there were not a lot of students utilizing the STEM lab. 
                        With the help of the ADM Cares Grant we were able to switch from a STEM lab to a STEAM class. For more information on what those classes have to offere see the pages for various levels of STEAM
                        offered here at Central A & M High School.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each year, there is some sort of update to the business and technology curriculum at Central A & M. At the start of the 2024-2025 school year, I will be starting new curriculum for Computer Concepts
                        as well as taking on the Media Production classroom. Previously, computer concepts was two weeks of learning compute hardware, 2 months of Google Docs, and 2 months of Google Slides. Advanced Computer
                        Concepts included 2 weeks of a deeper dive into computer hardware, 3 months of Google Sheets, and 1 month of Google Sites. With the updated curriculum, Computer concepts will encompass everything that
                        was taught in both Computer Concepts and Advanced Computer Concepts as well as a unit on Computer Programming.  Instead of Advanced Computer Concepts students will be able to take Media Production where
                        they will learn how to edit photos, videos, and audio recordings. 
                     </p>

                     <p>
                       The second update for the 2024-2025 school year is that we will no longer be offering the drones and robotics as a solo class. Instead that curriculum will be rolled into the Science Technology Engineering
                       Art and Mathematics (STEAM) curriculum.  I feel that the curriculum for drones and robitcs is best served as a class where students can utilize other aspects of STEAM while learning about drones and robotics.
                     </p>
